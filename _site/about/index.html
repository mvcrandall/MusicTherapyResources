<h2 id="about-the-site">About the Site</h2>

<p>This project was inspired by my years as a new music therapy professional working in the medical setting. Shortly after passing my certification exam, I was hired at an inpatient acute physical rehabilitation hospital and tasked with the challenge of creating a music therapy program. As a newbie to the profession, I scoured the internet looking for anything and everything to help me quickly broaden my knowledge of the setting and effectively communicate the role of music therapy to other healthcare profesisonals working with this population. However, these resources were not easy to find. I quickly began to notice that many non-music therapy resources had search prioirty over music therapy resources that actually represent the profession. Thus, the seed was planted for <b><i>Music Therapy Resources<b><i>.</i></b></i></b></p>

<p>The primary goal of this website is to improve the availability and accessibility of music therapy resources. It was designed to equip music therapy professionals and students with valuable teaching material for advocacy and professional development. Are you looking for a testimonial video to embed in an inservice that you are preparing? Do you need a concise handout to accompany your presentation? Are you looking for resources to develop your clinical and professional skill sets? Take a look around and see if the perfect resource is waiting for you.</p>

<p>It is my hope that as our professional community grows, our online presence can grow as well. Feel free to share any of the resources that you find here on social media. Let’s see if we flood search engine results with resources that represent our profession!</p>

<h2 id="about-the-creator">About the Creator</h2>

<div>
	<p>Bob Marley said, "One good thing about music , when it hits you, you feel no pain." 
	<p style="float: right;"><img src="/assets/img/photo.png" /></p>The truth in these words has defined my relationship with music. Whether I was coping with emotional pain or physical pain, I always found solace in music. My desire to bring this peace to others is what led me to the field of music therapy.</p>

<p>I received my Bachelor of Music in Music Therapy in 2014 at the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas. I completed clinical rotations in numerous settings including inpatient adult and pediatric psychiatric care, adult and pediatric daycare centers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and adult palliative care. I quickly found that my passion resided in providing music therapy to individuals in a medical setting. </p>

<p>I completed my internship at Warm Springs Rehabilitation Hospital of Thousand Oaks where I was then hired to create a permanent music therapy program after becoming a board-certified music therapist. I work with a variety of patients including, but not limited to, individuals recovering from physical trauma, stroke, or brain injury, as well as individuals who are coping with progressive illness such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, or cancer. I serve on both the stroke and the traumatic brain injury committees at WSTO and am currently working on the development of a cancer care program. I also serve on the planning committee for the Alamo Head Injury Association. My work with these populations led me to complete the training for Neurologic Music Therapy to further refine my ability to treat individuals with neurologic disorders. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts so that I may continue to offer the best level of care to the individuals that I serve.</p>
